WixApp -- Produces a Product.wxs file from a list of files.

What does this project do?

WixApp is a single dialog box that allows information about executable, dll, help and other files to
be combined into one install "msi" file using the WiX Toolset v3.  It does this by acceptng names
of files and producing a product.wxs file (preserving older versions).  The product.wxs file is compiled
by Visual Studio using the Wix Toolset compilation.

Why is this project useful?

Wix, while powerful is difficult code to write correctly the first time.  After many attempts at
getting it right, I just sat down one day and started this program.  It has been useful to me as
I don't need to thing too carefully about getting the WiX input right, I just need to make sure I
know all the files needed in the output.

How do I get started?

Write Hello World and install it.

This version was created with Visual Studion 2017.  It was compiled with the following properties:
   o  Windows SDK Version: 10.0.18362.0
   o  Platfor Toolset: visual Studio 2017 (v141)
   o  MFC: Use MFC in a Shared DLL
   o  Character Set:  Use Unicode Character Set
   o  Additional Include Directories:  $(SolutionDir)..\SrcFiles\;$(SolutionDir)..\..\Library\LibFiles\;
                                       $(SolutionDir)..\..\Library\AboutFiles\
   o  Precompiled Header:  Not Using Precompiled Headers
   o  Linker/Additional Dependencies:  Htmlhelp.lib

The HTML Help Workshop, Version 4.74.8702.0 was used to prepare the help file (WixApp.chm).  It is
copied into the Release directory.

Once the executable is created it can be used to create an installer.  Take a look at the help file for
details.

Prerequisites

The WiX Toolset must be installed in Visual Studio.  The HTML Help Workshop must be installed.  Some
version of Visual Studio and/or other c++ compiler/linker/debugger.

Give Examples

WixApp keeps data in an "wxd" file (for the WixApp it is: WixAppInstaller.wxd).  It is managed as an
Windows "ini" file, i.e sections in which there are names and values.  When the create button is
pressed the Wix file, Product.wxs, is produced.

================================================================================
    MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : WixApp Project Overview
===============================================================================

The application wizard has created this WixApp application for
you.  This application not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft
Foundation Classes but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your WixApp application.

WixApp.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an application wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    application wizard.

WixApp.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

WixApp.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    WixApp application class.

WixApp.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class WixApp.

WixApp.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++. Your project resources are in 1033.

res\WixApp.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file WixApp.rc.

res\WixApp.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft
    Visual C++. You should place all resources not editable by
    the resource editor in this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For the main frame window:
    The project includes a standard MFC interface.

MainFrm.h, MainFrm.cpp
    These files contain the frame class MainFrame, which is derived from
    CFrameWnd and controls all SDI frame features.

res\Toolbar.bmp
    This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar.
    The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the MainFrame
    class. Edit this toolbar bitmap using the resource editor, and
    update the IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR array in WixApp.rc to add
    toolbar buttons.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The application wizard creates one document type and one view:

WixAppDoc.h, WixAppDoc.cpp - the document
    These files contain your WixAppDoc class.  Edit these files to
    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading
    (via WixAppDoc::Serialize).

WixAppView.h, WixAppView.cpp - the view of the document
    These files contain your WixAppView class.
    WixAppView objects are used to view WixAppDoc objects.




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Other Features:

ActiveX Controls
    The application includes support to use ActiveX controls.

Printing and Print Preview support
    The application wizard has generated code to handle the print, print setup, and print preview
    commands by calling member functions in the CView class from the MFC library.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named WixApp.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

WixApp.manifest
 Application manifest files are used by Windows XP to describe an applications
 dependency on specific versions of Side-by-Side assemblies. The loader uses this
 information to load the appropriate assembly from the assembly cache or private
 from the application. The Application manifest  maybe included for redistribution
 as an external .manifest file that is installed in the same folder as the application
 executable or it may be included in the executable in the form of a resource.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Other notes:

The application wizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, you will need
to redistribute the MFC DLLs. If your application is in a language
other than the operating system's locale, you will also have to
redistribute the corresponding localized resources mfc110XXX.DLL.
For more information on both of these topics, please see the section on
redistributing Visual C++ applications in MSDN documentation.
